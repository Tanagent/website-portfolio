				<h1>Brian Tan</h1>
				<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
			</div>

			<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics on June 2016 from Cal Poly Pomona. I code and I design stuff. I am really passionate about what I do and I am very good at it. Java and Android development are what I primarily work in, for I am a total Android fanboy, but I tend to dabble around other languages like C# and JavaScript if I need to.</p>

			<p>I am into 3D and graphic design but I've been really interested in trying to get myself into big data. Machine learning and natural language processing is what fascinates me the most. My goal as of now is to gain some work experience and maybe sometimes along the line, I would probably go back to school to achieve a Master degree in a field of data science and work for a company like Google, particularly in the Allo department of Google.</p>
